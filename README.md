Project Details 
This Project is Clone of Netflix I have made this clone as a project given by Stige as my internship Project.The main aim behind developing this clone is to sharp my skills(HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT), I have completed many projects in frontend before this but this project helped me to understand concepts of making a responsive website.
Doing a project like this helps in understanding work of a Web Developer in real life, and I feel like I have achieved my aim after developing this clone. I have given my 100% into making this website exact similar to original Netflix website.
