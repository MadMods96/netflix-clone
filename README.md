**Project Details**<br>
This Project is Clone of Netflix I have made this clone as a project given by Stige as my internship Project.The main aim behind developing this clone is to sharp my skills(HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT), I have completed many projects in frontend before this but this project helped me to understand concepts of making a responsive website.
Doing a project like this helps in understanding work of a Web Developer in real life, and I feel like I have achieved my aim after developing this clone. I have given my 100% into making this website exact similar to original Netflix website.
This Project Has 3 main Pages Which are :
1.	Home Page
2.	Sign In Page
3.	Browse Page  
#Home Page – Original Page at https://www.netflix.com/in/

<br>##Please Ignore Php As only used to deploy the website on Heruku##<br>
 
This Is the Home page of the Netflix.com website. Let us see the home page developed by me in my project.
 
This looks similar to original one as I have used different font style but still its similar.
Now, look more into project. Let us see similarities of pages in real and clones. Here is the first section showing a picture which shows a Netflix feature that it can be streamed on Tv too.

I had Added a browser feature but it is only availale for paid members but i have made it somehow possible to show you guys here itself.
You can also see deployment of this project.<br>
**Approach**<br>
I have Taken All Pics And videos From Netflix database itself but used my own skills to code and develop. I have used visual studio code as editor then I have written down the sections and features of website in a notebook and then I have downloaded the necessary files and images.

I was saving all changes and gone with some tutorials to understand some necessary concepts after that I have developed the home page and designed it then developed sign in page with same footer and at last made a browser page which is only accessible to paid members only.

Languages Used
In Developing Netflix clone I Have Used Three Languages Mainly Used to make a web page are :
1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	JAVASCRIPT<br>
I have used visual Studio Code to Write And Check My Code because it provides the facility of live server on which changes take place automatically when we save our code.
<br>**Why HTML/CSS and JS?**<br>
HTML helped me to make a good structure of webpage and it has given me elements to move ahead in adjusting them.
CSS helped me to design my web page to look attractive and User friendly, also it made easy browse for user and made my website fully responsive.
JAVASCRIPT helped me to provide a good and functional existence on web page. Also it helped me to hide element when they are of no use or till they are not used.

**Feedback:**
I want to thank you for giving this amazing topic for the project I have used my own skills to develop this whole website and this has developed a level of confidence and I feel more confident then back I was doing.

Thank You….
